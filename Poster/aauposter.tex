%   Windows: ansinew
%            latin1 (works in most cases)
%   Mac    : applemac
% Notice that you can manually change the input
% encoding of your files by selecting "save as"
% an select the desired input encoding. 
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
% Make latex understand and use the typographic
% rules of the language used in the document.
