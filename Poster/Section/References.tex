  \item Posters are often used at conferences for presenting exciting new research results.
  \item So far no official AAU poster theme is available to the researchers and students at Aalborg University (AAU).
  \item The present theme changes this.
  \item The theme is a particular configuration of the \alert{baposter} poster template \cite{baposter} which you can find here \url{http://www.brian-amberg.de/uni/poster/} and must have installed in order to use the AAU poster theme.
