  \begin{itemize}
  	\item The AAU poster theme v. 1.1.0 has been tested with baposter v. 2.0, and it can be downloaded from my AAU website \cite{jknaau} or my personal website \cite{jknsqrt-1}.
  	\item If you find a bug in the AAU theme (and not in the baposter template), please do not hesitate to contact me. There is a FAQ at the baposter website \cite{baposter}, if you should have any problems with it.
  \end{itemize}
