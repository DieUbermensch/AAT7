\begin{itemize}
	\item The proposed method of combining FXLMS with LP ($P=10$) has proven to improve the attenuation of a speech signal (50 Hz-4000 Hz) by 34 dB compared to a FXLMS system without LP.
	\item The predictor is reliant on short term stationary signals in order to predict future samples. The method used is Wiener filtering, which is often used in speech encoding, coupled in cascade for predicting up to 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz.
	\item Listen to our results: \#QR-CODE
