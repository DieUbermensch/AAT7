%%ANC headphones are becoming widely used in consumer electronics, however often the attenuation decreases rapidly with an increased frequency. 
%%This is due to the delays introduced by sampling and reconstructing the signals.
%This can be due to delay in the ANC system. 
%A Linear Prediction (LP) algorithm is proposed to predict $P$ samples, corresponding to the system delay, to compensate for the delay.

 ANC headphones are becoming increasingly popular, especially for canceling speech. 
 In order to cancel speech, a feedforward solution is proposed.
 However this method introduces increasingly large delay, and to accommodate this problem, a Linear Prediction (LP) algorithm is proposed to predict $P$ samples
 of the speech signal, thus compensating for the delay.
