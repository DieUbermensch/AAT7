%%ANC headphones are becoming widely used in consumer electronics, however often the attenuation decreases rapidly with an increased frequency. 
%%This is due to the delays introduced by sampling and reconstructing the signals.
%This can be due to delay in the ANC system. 
%A Linear Prediction (LP) algorithm is proposed to predict $P$ samples, corresponding to the system delay, to compensate for the delay.

%The simulated test setup consists of a reference microphone (1), a headphone speaker (2), an error microphone (3) and a DSP (4). %The delays are introduced by sampling the microphones and playing the counterphase signal through the loudspeaker.\\

%% % ANC headphones are becoming increasingly popular, especially for canceling speech. 
% In order to cancel speech, a feedforward solution is proposed.
% However this method introduces increasingly large delay, and to accommodate this problem, a Linear Prediction (LP) algorithm is proposed to predict $P$ samples
% of the speech signal, thus compensating for the delay.

%ANC headphones are used to attenuate various noise sources, among these are speech.


%Active Noise Control (ANC) headphones lack the ability to attenuate speech.
%In order to remedy this problem, a feedforward system is necessary.
%This feedforward topology introduces delay, which decreases the attenuation of the system.
%In order to compensate for delay, a Linear Prediction (LP) scheme is proposed.



% C verison:
Active Noise Control (ANC) headphones have limited speech attenuation.
When using a digital solution, delays are introduced, which decreases attenuation. This can be remedied with Linear Prediction (LP).
%This feedforward topology introduces delay, which decreases the attenuation of the system.
