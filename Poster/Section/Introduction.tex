ANC headphones are becoming widely used in consumer electronics, however often the attenuation decrease rapidly width increased frequency. This is due to the delays introduced by sampling and reconstructing the signals.
A Linear Prediction (LP) algorithm is proposed to predict P samples corresponding to the system delay, to compensate for the delay.

The simulated test setup consists of a reference microphone (1), a headphone speaker (2), an error microphone (3) and a DSP (4). The delays are introduced by sampling the microphones and playing the counterphase signal through the speaker.\\
