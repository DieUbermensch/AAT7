\begin{itemize}
\item Combining LP with FXLMS has, through simulations, proven to increase the attenuation of a system where delays are present. \\
\item The predictor is capable of predicting 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz. When predicting $>$14 samples the predicted signal distorts. If the distorted signal is then passed through the FXLMS algorithm the distortion will not be attenuated.\\
\item In order to make a real time implementation of the algorithm, certain physical parameters must be considered; firstly the error microphone(3) can not be placed inside the users ear. \\ Secondly the computational cost of the predictor should be decreased.
%Possibly by using a multirate system. %working at a lower sampling frequency as in telecommunications. This could be implemented as a multirate system, to also allow playback of signals with higher fs.
