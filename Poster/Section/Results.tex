You cannot use floats in the baposter template. However, you can use figure captions by using {\tt \textbackslash captionof} instead of {\tt \textbackslash caption}. This is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:figlabel}. Moreover, you can also use {\tt \textbackslash label} and {\tt \textbackslash ref} to make references to your figures and/or tables.
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics{aau_logo_new}
	\captionof{figure}{Here is a figure caption}
	\label{fig:figlabel}
\end{center}
As you can see, the text background is not white. If your figures do not have a transparent background, this may look too ugly for you. You can of course change the background colour through the {\tt boxColorOne} option. Alternatively, you can make the background transparent. In Matlab, the following example demonstrates how this is done\par
{\tt
	f1 = figure(1);\\
	set(f1,'Color','none');
}\par
You can also use {\tt pgfplots} \cite{pgfplots} for plotting your Matlab data. This is not that hard and the resulting plots are much nicer than Matlab plots, so I will strongly recommend that you have a look at {\tt pgfplots} right here \url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgfplots/}.
