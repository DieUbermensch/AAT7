 \textbf{Optimizing the LP parameters}\\
 	The parameters; framelength $N$ and the overlap of frames $O$ are varied in order to determine the values for which the Prediction Gain (PG), is largest. The optimal coefficients are $N=1200$ and $O=1100$.

	\textbf{System Delay Attenuation}\\
Without introduced system delay, prediction is unnecessary, as the FXLMS algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) alone, will achieve infinite attenuation. For increasing system delay, a LP FXLMS (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}) has an increased attenuation, of up to 40 dB for delays below 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz.

%	If no system delay is present no prediction is needed, because the FXLMS algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) achieves infinite attenuation.
%	The attenuation of the non-predicting algorithm decreases with delay. The predicting algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}) however attenuate speech by $\geq$ 40 dB for delays of up to 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz.
