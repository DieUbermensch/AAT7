 \textbf{Optimizing the LP parameters}\\
The parameters; framelength $N$ and the overlap of frames $O$ are varied for $P=10$ and $f_s=48$ $k$Hz. This is to determine the parameters for which the Prediction Gain (PG) is largest. 
 	The optimal parameters are found to be $N=1200$ and $O=1100$.

	\textbf{System Delay Attenuation}\\
Without system delays, prediction is unnecessary, as the FXLMS algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) alone, will achieve infinite attenuation. For increasing system delay, a LP FXLMS (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}), using the optimal parameters, has an increased attenuation of minimum 40 dB for delays below 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz.

%	If no system delay is present no prediction is needed, because the FXLMS algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) achieves infinite attenuation.
%	The attenuation of the non-predicting algorithm decreases with delay. The predicting algorithm (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}) however attenuate speech by $\geq$ 40 dB for delays of up to 14 samples at 48 $k$Hz.

\textbf{Frequency response comparison}\\
The frequency response of the FXLMS (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) and LP FXLMS (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}) are filtered using a 1/3 octave filter-bank.
The attenuation of the LP FXLMS is increased by up to 30 dB.

%The frequency content of the FXLMS, (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) is not changed much by the predictor (\textcolor{MATLABred}{---}), but the attenuation is increased by $\geq$ 15 dB.
