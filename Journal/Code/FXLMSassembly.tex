\textit{The FXLMS algorithm was implemented on the DSP. At the point of validation, the system was deemed to computationally heavy and the chosen hardware platform was measured to have too large latency for implementation. Resulting in the algorithm being deemed none essential and hence not subject for validation.} 

\subsection{Description}
This function updates the coefficients given in b in order to minimize the error e using the FXLMS method. As given by the equation from \autoref{sec:systemDesign}
\begin{equation}
	b_n(k+1)=b_n(k)-2\mu e(k)x(k-n)
\end{equation}
Where $k$ is the time index and n is the coefficient index.

\subsection{Syntax} 
\begin{lstlisting}
	extern void  FXLMS(Int16 *x, Int16 *b, Int16 error, Int16 index, Int16 *uN );
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Variables}
\begin{lstlisting}
	Int16 	*x 		//The input signal
	Int16	*b		//The filter coefficients
	Int16	error	//The error from the error microphone
	Int16	index	//The index of the newest x sample
	Int16	*uN		//vector containing -2u and the Order of the filter.
\end{lstlisting}
