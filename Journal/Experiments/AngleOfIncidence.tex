\section{The angle of Incidences influence on the headphone transfer function}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the angle of incidence has any influence on the headphone transfer function. The hypothesis is that the angle on incidence influences both the time delay and magnitude response of the transfer function. \\ 
If the hypothesis holds it might be necessary to mount more microphones on the headset to allow source tracking.
