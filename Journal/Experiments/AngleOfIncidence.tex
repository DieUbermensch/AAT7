\section{The angle of Incidences influence on the headphone transfer function}

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the angle of incidence has any influence on the headphone transfer function and the cancellation path. 

The hypothesis is that the angle on incidence influences both the time delay and magnitude response of the transfer functions.

Measurements will only be performed in a horizontal plane.

\subsection{Settings/Description}
The experiment uses a single speaker to measure angles of incidence. Therefore either the speaker has to be moved around or the HATS will have to be turned to the right angles. \\
Adjusting the angle is done by rotating the HATS around the centre of the HATS leaving the speaker in place. This creates a triangle between the speaker, microphone and inner microphone of the HATS. The baseline of the triangle is from the microphone to the inner microphone, and angle is adjusted according to that line.
The following angles are examined:

		0 & 10 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 70 & 80 & 90 \\ \bottomrule

\label{Tab:AngleOfInciMeasAngles}
\caption{angles that measurements should be performed at. 0\textdegree is the situation in \autoref{fig:AngOfIndOnax}}
\end{table}
 
% The following Matlab code is used to calculate the angles at which measurements should be performed. The first measurement is performed at a 180\textdegree angle. This determines the length of the baseline (maxI in the code below). After determining the angles of interest can be calculated.  \\
%The script is based on two triangles that share a corner, the turning point, and a side to the speaker. The two triangles share the same angle at the turning point. This creates for two equations with two unknowns using the cosine relation and the fact that the side opposite the turning point should have a length "x" in one triangle and "x" + an amount of samples in the other triangle. Using this the angle can  be found.

\subsection{Choice of equipment}
The experiment aims to be valid in the frequency range 20Hz to 20 kHz. This means that all equipment used should cover that frequency range. \\\\
The experiment uses a total of three microphones. The error microphone located inside the dummy's ear is chosen as the one already fitted namely XXXX. The SpeakerMic should be as small as possible in order to avoid influencing the transfer functions that are being measured. For this the very small XXXX is used. The Ref microphone has less restrictions on size and placement. This allows for the choice of a good standard measurement microphone, XXXX. \\\\
For the speaker the limiting criteria is the lower roll off, especially in the anechoic chamber were reflections does not help a lot. However transfer functions between the microphones are measured, so absolute flatness is not critical. The Genelec XXXX is chosen. \\\\
The measurement system uses a RME Fireface 802 controlled using Simulink. Data extraction is made using the method described in \autoref{Sec:MeasATransFunc}

\subsection{Control and calibration}
The speaker is placed 1.6 meters from the centre of the HATS. \\\\
The two microphones SpeakerMic and Ref are fixed at distances 8.85 cm and 12.45 cm from the centre respectively. \\\\
For each microphone and preamplifier calibrations are made on the computer using Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. The following settings are present:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 93.6 dB (-0.4 is subtracted from 94 dB due to adapters) $@$ 1000 Hz is used as calibration signal
	\item Microphone sensitivity is controlled to 110 $m$V/Pa
	\item Measurement amplifier is set to -10 dB default
	\item Calibration signal yields an amplitude of XXX relative to 0 dBFS
	\item  Calibration signal yields a spike of XXX dB SPL at 1000 Hz, which requires a XXX dB SPL adjustment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Equipment settings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This experiment is performed with a sampling rate of, $F_{s}$ = 48,000 Hz
	\item The Ref microphone is placed just outside the headset in-line with the ear and speaker unit
	\item The SpeakerMic is placed inside the headphone, as close to the speaker unit as possible. 
	\item For item 4 (sound card) take care to turn on the "inst" option in the mixing console. The following gain settings are present: 		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Line level gain is 0 dB
		\item Error Microphones has gain
		\item Ref Microphones has gain
		\item Speaker Microphones has gain
	\end{itemize}
	\item Item 5 (computer) is set to 0 dBFS
	\item A logarithmic sine sweep is generated and saved in Matlab using the chirp function as follows:
	\begin{lstlisting} [language=Matlab	]
		IHope=10; % lala
	\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}
