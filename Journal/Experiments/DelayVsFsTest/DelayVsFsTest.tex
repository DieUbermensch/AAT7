\section{Determining Hardware Delay} \label{sec:HardwareDelay}

\subsection{Purpose}
The following section describes a test determining the conversion delay on the Texas Instruments TMS320C5515 eZdsp.

The conversion delay of the platform is important when chosing parameters for the simulated predictor. With the conversion delay determined it is possible to  make the simulations with a feasible delay. 

\subsection{AAU number list}
Table \ref{tab:MeasDelayTable} shows the equipment used in the experiment. These items have been selected due to the low frequencies being measured. The Analog Discovery 2 has a bandwidth of 25 Mhz and 100M Samples/s, making the resolution sufficient.

\subsection{Settings/Description}


\subsubsection{Calibration}
To ensure that the DSP is running at the desired frequencies, a probing of the development boards XF pin is done. This pin is flipped according to the sampling frequency, shown in listing \ref{lst:samplingbasic}, line 15 \& 19. The output of the 48 and 192 khz is show in figure \ref{fig:countingthefs}.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Equipment settings}
The TMS320C5515eZdsp is connected to the DSP board where the TLV320AIC3204 codec is connected via 3.5mm minijack cable (dashed lines in \autoref{fig:SchematicDelayExperiment} ) to the board. The oscilloscopes probes are then connected to the on-board BNC connectors. This is shown on figure \ref{fig:SchematicDelayExperiment}.It should be noted that even though the expansion Board is equipped with 16 kHz first order lowpass filter, the probes were applied "after" the filters. this can be seen on figure \ref{fig:DelayExperimentSetup}.
\\
To determine the sampling delay of the system a simple program is used, where the samples are passed through the system without any interaction. This ensures that no time is spent for calculations in the program. A step on the input signal will result in an delayed step on the output. The time difference in the steps will yield the conversion delay of the system directly. The delay takes into account the needed time for AA-filtering after oversampling and reconstruction in the $\Sigma\Delta$-converters. Using a low frequency as the signal will create a frame showing only on step, making the readout easier, this is shown in figure \ref{fig:ScopeDelayExperiment}.

Listing \ref{lst:samplingbasic} shows the main code for looping the stereo codec. The code shows the sampling of the input register when ready, and writing to the output register when ready. 

\begin{lstlisting} [language=C,label={lst:samplingbasic},caption={The code example used to pass a sample through the DSP and codec}]
void main( void )
{
/* Initialize Board and Codec - look in "aic3204_setup.h" */
USBSTK5515_init();
codec_init ();
%initAll();
while ( 1 )
{
/* Read Digital audio */
while((Rcv & I2S0_IR) == 0);  // Wait for interrupt pending flag
data3 = I2S0_W0_MSW_R;    // 16 bit left channel received audio data
data1 = I2S0_W0_LSW_R;
data4 = I2S0_W1_MSW_R;    // 16 bit right channel received audio data
data2 = I2S0_W1_LSW_R;
asm(" bset XF");	  	  // Set XF flag high

/* Write Digital audio */
while((Xmit & I2S0_IR) == 0);  // Wait for interrupt pending flag
asm(" bclr XF");		   // Set XF flag low
I2S0_W0_MSW_W = data3;     // 16 bit left channel transmit audio data
I2S0_W0_LSW_W = 0;
I2S0_W1_MSW_W = data4;     // 16 bit right channel transmit audio data
I2S0_W1_LSW_W = 0;
}}

\subsection{Procedure}
\subsubsection{Set-up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The DSP is mounted onto the DSP Freedom Board
	\item  Connect the DSP board with 3.5 mm mini-jack cable to Input 1 and 2.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item This ensures that bypass of the lowpass filters is possible
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Connect OUT1 and IN1 from the oscilloscope to Input 1 on the board with BNC cables.
	\item Connect IN2 from the oscilloscope to the Input 2 on the board.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performing the experiment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start Code Composer Studio V.6 and load \path{AIC3204C6.cproject}
	\item Change sampling frequency in \path{aic3204_Setup.h} by changing the defined ADCFs to:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 48
		\item 96
		\item 192
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Start Waveform 2015 to control the oscilloscope
	\item The oscilloscope is set to trigger at the rise of IN1
	\item Apply a 2 Hz square wave to OUT1 on the oscilloscope
	\item Save measurement IN1 and IN2 on oscilloscope in a \path{.CSV} file
	\item Repeat step 3 through 6 with different sampling frequencies as stated in step 2
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data extraction}

The data from the experiment is saved as \path{.CSV} files. These files can be found at:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \path{48kHz2Hz500mV.csv}
	\item \path{96kHz2Hz500mV.csv}
	\item \path{192kHz2Hz500mV.csv}
\end{itemize}

Each file contains the 2 Hz and corresponding output of the codec, with a resolution of 8000 points over a period, T = 1.2 $m$s.


\subsection{Analysis}\label{sec:AnalysisFsDelay}
The outputs from the three test are plotted on figure \ref{fig:ScopeDelayExperiment}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The blue line (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}) graph shows input step.
	\item The purple line (\textcolor{MATLABpurple}{---}) shows the 192 $k$Hz output
	\begin{itemize}
		\item corresponding to 225 $\mu$s
	\end{itemize}
	\item The yellow line (\textcolor{MATLAByellow}{---}) shows the 96 $k$Hz output
	\begin{itemize}
		\item corresponding to 450 $\mu$s
	\end{itemize}
	\item The orange line (\textcolor{MATLABorange}{---}) shows the 48 $k$Hz output
	\begin{itemize}
		\item corresponding to 900 $\mu$s
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{DelaySetupCSVRead}
	\input{figures/Hardware/DelayGraph.tex}
	\caption{Readout form the oscilloscope showing steps at different f$_s$ . The blue line is the step, f$_s$ = 48 $k$Hz(orange), f$_s$ = 96 $k$Hz(yellow) and f$_s$ = 192 $k$Hz(purple). Note that step has been offset for visual overview.}
	\label{fig:ScopeDelayExperiment}
\end{figure}

In equation \ref{eq:sampleDelay} it is seen that the delay of conversion corresponds to a delay of 43 samples if 48 $k$Hz is chosen.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sampleDelay}
	\frac{48000\text{ Samples}}{1s} \cdot 900\cdot 10^{-6}\text{s} = 43 \text{ Samples} 
\end{equation}

%		192 & 225 & 43
%	\end{tabular} 
%	\caption{The measured delay in both time and samples according to the sampling frequency}

%\end{table}


\subsection{Accuracy \& error sources}

The steps are captured using a single 8000-points frame, as shown in figure \ref{fig:ScopeDelayExperiment}. The output was noisy and had a slew-rate of $\pm$ 10 $\mu $s on all trials. The measurements noted in section \ref{sec:AnalysisFsDelay} were measured at the start of the step eliminating the effect of the slew-rate. However when implemented, the slew-rate delay in the converter has to be taken into account.


\subsection{Conclusion}
The conversion delay of the chosen platform is determined to be 43 samples at 48 $k$Hz, 96 $k$Hz and 192 $k$Hz corresponding to 900 $\mu$s, 450 $\mu$s and 225 $\mu$s, respectively.
% too large to be efficient for an actual implementation. The delay of the system forces it to become non-causal, deeming the platform not suitable for implementation. It should however be noted that a change in converter type or samplerate could solve the problem, this has not been further analyzed due to the scope of this project.
