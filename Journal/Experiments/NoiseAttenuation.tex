\section{Noise Attenuation Measurements}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this experience is to determine the SNR needed to understand speech in a noisy office environnement.

\subsubsection{Settings/Description}

Our setting aims at reproducing an office sound field. We choosed to reproduce the sound field with 4 speakers. 
The idea is to reproduce a real life situation in an office that's why speech and office background noise will be played on the speaker. 
The listener who stands in front of speakers will also receive a speech sounds in the headset. This set up emulates a call in a noisy office.

The listener will have control over a matlab script that control the background noise. His role will be to find the noise ratio needed in order to: 1) fully understand the speech 2) not be disturbed by the noise (i.e confort ratio)

\subsection{Procedure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Place test subject in listening position.
	\item Instruct test subject referring to section \ref{subsubsec:attenuationInformation}.
	\item Test subject will put on headphones and adjust them.
	\item Run Simulink \path{XX.mat} with testnumber 1
	\item Test subject select noise level through control
	\item Operator notes the attenuation value
	\item Repeat step 4-6, with testnumber 2 and 3
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Information}\label{subsubsec:attenuationInformation}
Read the following to the test subject:

\textit{In a moment, you will put on the headphones. The speakers around you will play background noise and speech. The headphones will play a recorded voice. Your task is to adjust the volume of the noise using the arrow keys infront of you. The noise level will start at maximum level. When you have found the level at which the noise is not a disturbance to your understanding of the voice notify the operator. The test will repeated three times with different voices. Any questions?}


\begin{enumerate}
\item We will play on the speakers office environnement sounds and speech. 
\item The listener will put the headphones on.
\item We will play in the headphones the file "speech1"
\item The listener will then adjust the sound level on the speakers thank to a keyboard operating a matlab script. The listener will then stop adjusting the level when he reachs a level of "non disturbance"
\item The listener will then adjust the sound level on the speakers thank to a keyboard operating a matlab script. The listener will then stop adjusting the level when he reachs a level of "non disturbance" "Speech understanding"
\item We note the two attenuation levels for the given recording
\item We change the file being played in the headphone and repeat the experience from 3.
\end{enumerate}


The test will be carried out at the following gain settings. Gain 1 corresponds to a SPL of LALA of the noice sources at the listeners position. (Calibrated at slider-gain 1) \\\\

\subsection{Data Extraction}

Results will be extracted manualy from Matlab to excel in order to analyse it

\subsection{Analysis}

Compute statistics in Excel in order to find the overall attenuation needed by the system to be efficient.

\subsection{Error Sources}
\begin{itemize}
\item While our main error source might be human, we want to minimise the way we interact with him in order to not misslead him.
\item Audio sample level mesurement.
