\subsection{Settings/Description}
\label{SettingsCacellationPath}

Calibration of the microphone and associated preamplifier is done on the computer using Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. The following settings are present:

\subsubsection{Control and calibration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 93.6 dB due to being a pressure field microphone $@$ 250 Hz is used as calibration signal.
	\item Microphone sensitivity is controlled to 11.6 $m$V/Pa.
	\item Calibration signal yields an amplitude of 0.6 relative to 0 dBFS.
	\item Calibration signal yields a spike at 95.5 dB SPL @250 Hz, which then requires a -2.3 dB SPL adjustment.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Equipment settings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This experiment is performed with a sampling rate of, $F_{s}$ = 48 $k$Hz.
	\item Item 4 (sound capture card):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "SENS(INPUT 1/L)" is set to +0 dB.
			\item "SENS(INPUT 2/R)" is set to +0 dB.
			\item "PHONES" is set to maximum volume.
		\end{itemize}		
	\item Item 5 (computer) is set to 0 dBFS.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Procedure}
\subsubsection{Set-up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set instruments to comply with the list in \ref{SettingsCacellationPath}.
	\item Control and calibrate item 2 using item 7.
	\item Place item 3 onto item 1 ("Henry"'s head and ears).
	\item Insert item 2's connector into input of item 6.
	\item Connect item 6 to item 4 and connect item 4 to item 5 via USB.
	\item Insert item 3's connector into output of item 4.
	\item Connect cable from item 4's output to item 4's input.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performing the experiment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and open and run file \path{SimulinkSystemCancellationPath.xls}.
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item The simulations outputs a logarithmic chirp from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with an amplitude of 0 dBFS over the span of five seconds.
		\item The simulation runs for six seconds.
	\end{itemize}
	%\item Through Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} play "LogChirp.wav" from item 5 via item 4
	\item Rename outputted files "Mic" and "Ref" to "Mic[i].wav" and "Ref[i].wav" \footnote{[i] indicates the iteration of the experiment.}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[] Perform this experiment for a total of five times.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
If  a discontinuity in the recorded signal(s) occurs, then discard that recording and reperform the experiment for the current iteration.


\subsubsection{Data Extraction}
\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Place generated .wav-files in same folder as MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-script "CancellationPathScript.m".
	\item Start MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and run script \path{CancellationPathScript.m}.
\end{enumerate}
From performing of the experiment, ten files has been generated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mic1.wav - Mic5.wav
	\item Ref1.wav - Ref5.wav
\end{itemize}

These files are the results of performing the six second simulation which gives a number of 288,768 samples, for each generated .wav-file.
An example showing outputted Mic1 and Ref1 is shown in  \autoref{AmplitudePlotCancellationPath}.

	\caption{Time plot of the cancellation path with the reference signal(blue) and the microphone signal(orange).}
	\label{AmplitudePlotCancellationPath}
\end{figure}

MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-script \path{CancellationPathScript.m} is used for data extraction and analysis.



\subsection{Analysis}
The impulse response of the CP is to be found.
Note that a microphone with external polarization was used. It means that there is a 180\textdegree phase difference between pre- and external polarized microphones, i.e. a positive pressure leads to negative voltage. The externally polarized microphone is considered to be out of phase. \cite{michandbook}

First the cross correlation between Mic[i] and Ref[i] is found. This is done by cross correlating the two signals signals. Secondly the signal is taken into the frequency domain by applying the FT to the signal. This is expressed in \autoref{FrequencyResponseCPEq2}.



\begin{equation}\label{FrequencyResponseCPEq2}
%H(f) = \frac{Y(m_{\mu}) *  X(r_{\mu})}{X(r_{\mu}) *  X(r_{\mu})}
H(f) = \frac{Y(f) \cdot X\textsuperscript{*}(f)}{X(f) \cdot X\textsuperscript{*}(f)}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{description}
	%\item " $*$ " denotes the complex conjugation
	\item $H(f)$ is the FT of the CP.
	\item $Y(f)$ is the FT of the recorded microphone signals, Mic[i].
	\item $X(f)$ is the FT of the recorded reference signals, Ref[i].
\end{description}

The frequency response of the CP is shown in \autoref{FrequencyResponsePlotCancellationPath}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathFrequencyResponse1}
	%\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/CP_freqresp.tex}
	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/FreqResponseCP.tex}
	\caption{Frequency response plot of the cancellation path.}
	\label{FrequencyResponsePlotCancellationPath}
\end{figure}

The impulse response of this CP is found by taking the IFT (Inverse Fourier Transform) of the frequency response.
The impulse response is shown on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponse}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathImpulseResponse1}

	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/impulsefull.tex}
	\caption{Impulse response plot of the cancellation path see \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop} for zoomed in version.}

\end{figure}

Converting the impulse response from magnitude to dB, gives the time decay which reveals the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the system, and from the read off SNR is found to be $\sim$ 60 dB SNR, as seen on \autoref{TimeDecayPlotCancellationPath}.

	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/snr.tex}
	\caption{Time decay plot of the cancellation path}
	\label{TimeDecayPlotCancellationPath}
\end{figure}


Taking the first 256 coefficients of the impulse response gives the following cropped impulse response, as seen on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop1}
	%\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop.tex}
	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/impulseresponse.tex}
	\caption{Cropped impulse response plot of the cancellation path}
	\label{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop}
\end{figure}

To verify that the frequency response of the cropped impulse response approximately equals that of the non-cropped impulse response the two frequency responses are compared. This can be seen on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}. Note that the two lines are almost completely on top of each other.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare1}
	%\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare.tex}
	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/compfilter.tex}
	\caption{Comparison of the frequency response of 960 coefficients vs. 288,768 coefficients.}
	\label{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}, 960 coefficients is shown to be sufficient for representing the impulse response with good accuracy. 

\subsection{Error Sources / Tolerances}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Placement of the actuators and test-devices. (Position of the headset on the ear  influence the frequency response at high frequency which is not the main scope of study).
	\item Instrument inaccuracies see \autoref{TolerancesCP}.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Conclusion}
It can be concluded that an impulse response in the form of 256 coefficients, see \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponse}, is found for the "Cancellation path".
%The impulse response on  shows the coefficients of the system, and a file containing all 256 is generated with the name "CoeffientsCP.mat"
