\section{HDA 200 Cancellation Path} \label{sec:CPjournal}
\textbf{Note:} This was the initial experiment to determine the impulse response of the used headphone, later the headphone was changed and a new experiment was done. The results of this experiment are therefore obsolete. The new experiment can be seen in \autoref{sec:DT770CPjournal}.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this experiment is to make a model of the CP, by determining its impulse response, i.e. the transfer function between the "headphone loudspeaker" and the "error microphone (ear)".

\subsection{Settings/Description}
\label{SettingsCacellationPath}

Calibration of the microphone and associated preamplifier is done on the computer using Simulink. The following settings are present:

\subsubsection{Control and calibration}
\begin{itemize}
	%\todoOliver{We have later found 95.6dB using an other calibrator - are you certain about this value???}
	\item Microphone sensitivity is controlled to 11.6 $m$V/Pa.
	\item The microphone in the HATS (2) is calibrated on the computer using Simulink.
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Calibration is made @ 250 Hz using the calibrator (7) with adapter for the ear simulator (2). This should yield a signal of 93.6 dB. The measured intensity in Matlab was 95.5 dB so all measurements are multiplied by 0.8035 to get a calibrated signal in Matlab.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Equipment settings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This experiment is performed with a sampling rate of, $f_{s}$ = 48 $k$Hz.
	\item Roland Edirol:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "SENS(INPUT 1/L)" is set to +0 dB.
			\item "SENS(INPUT 2/R)" is set to +0 dB.
			\item "PHONES" is set to maximum volume. 
			%\todoOliver{Should we mention, that this might be a bad idea?-meybe listen if recordings are distorted??}\ 
			%Oliver: I don't think so, but I'll check the recordings
		\end{itemize}		
	\item All gains on the computer is set to 0 dBFS.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Procedure}
\subsubsection{Set-up}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Set instruments to comply with the list in \ref{SettingsCacellationPath}.
	\item Calibrate the microphone using the calibrator. 
	\item Place the headphone on the HATS.
	\item Insert the microphone connector into the power supplys input.
	\item Connect the power supply output to the input of the Roland Edirol.
	\item Connect the Roland Edirol with the computer via USB.
	\item Connect the headphones to the phones output of the Roland Edirol.
	\item Connect a loopback from the Roland Edirol output to its input.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performing the experiment}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start Simulink and open and run file:\\ \path{SimulinkSystemCancellationPath.slx}.
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item The simulation outputs a logarithmic chirp from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz with an amplitude of 0 dBFS over the span of five seconds.
		\item The simulation runs for six seconds.
	\end{itemize}
	%\item Through Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} play "LogChirp.wav" from item 5 via item 4
	\item Rename outputted files "Mic.wav" and "Ref.wav" to "Mic[i].wav" and "Ref[i].wav" \footnote{[i] indicates the iteration of the experiment.}
\end{enumerate}
Perform this experiment for a total of five times. If  a drop-out in the recorded signals occurs, then discard that recording and redo the experiment for the current iteration. 


\subsection{Data Extraction}
\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Place generated .wav-files in same folder as MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered}-script "CancellationPathScript.m".
	\item Start Matlab and run script \path{CancellationPathScript.m}.
\end{enumerate}
From performing the experiment, ten files has been generated:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mic1.wav, Mic2.wav, Mic3.wav, Mic4.wav and Mic5.wav
	\item Ref1.wav, Ref2.wav, Ref3.wav, Ref4.wav and Ref5.wav
\end{itemize}

These files are the results of performing the six second simulation which gives a number of 288,768 samples, 
%\todoOliver{This is not 48000 *6 ??} for each generated .wav-file.
%Oliver: For the first recording we got that amount of samples, not sure of the reason for this though, but those are the numbers Kiis gave me :P
The recorded Mic1 and Ref1 is shown in  \autoref{AmplitudePlotCancellationPath}.

	\caption{Time plot of the cancellation path with the reference signal(blue) and the microphone signal(orange).}
	\label{AmplitudePlotCancellationPath}
\end{figure}

Matlab-script \path{CancellationPathScript.m} is used for data extraction and analysis.



\subsection{Analysis}
The impulse response of the CP is to be found.
Note that the Ref microphone has a 180$\degree$ phase inversion. Therefore all impulses are inverted. When the data is later used it should be inverted again to yield the correct phase. \cite{michandbook}

%First the cross correlation between Mic[i] and Ref[i] is found. This is done by cross correlating the two signals signals. Secondly the signal is taken into the frequency domain by applying the FT to the signal. This is expressed in \autoref{FrequencyResponseCPEq2}.
To extract the frequency response the method described in \autoref{Sec:MeasATransFunc} is used.


%\begin{equation}\label{FrequencyResponseCPEq2}
%H(f) = \frac{Y(m_{\mu}) *  X(r_{\mu})}{X(r_{\mu}) *  X(r_{\mu})}
%H(f) = \frac{Y(f) \cdot X\textsuperscript{*}(f)}{X(f) \cdot X\textsuperscript{*}(f)}
%\end{equation}
%Where:
%\begin{description}
%	%\item " $*$ " denotes the complex conjugation
%	\item $H(f)$ is the FT of the CP.
%	\item $Y(f)$ is the FT of the recorded microphone signals, Mic[i].
%	\item $X(f)$ is the FT of the recorded reference signals, Ref[i].
%\end{description}

The frequency response of the CP is shown in \autoref{FrequencyResponsePlotCancellationPath}.

	frequency response 4 (\textcolor{MATLABpurple}{---}), 	
	frequency response 5 (\textcolor{MATLABgreen}{---}).}
	\label{FrequencyResponsePlotCancellationPath}
\end{figure}

%\todoOliver{Is this freqresp averaged over the 5 measurements?}
%Should be - I'll check

The impulse response of this CPs is found by taking the inverse Fourier transform (IFT) of the five frequency responses. 
The impulse responses are shown on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponse}.

	impulse response 5 (\textcolor{MATLABgreen}{---}). }
	\label{CancellationPathImpulseResponse}
\end{figure}

%Converting the impulse response from magnitude to dB, gives the time decay which reveals the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of the system, and from the read off SNR is found to be $\sim$ 50 dB SNR, as seen on \autoref{TimeDecayPlotCancellationPath}.

%\todoKiis{many question: 256 coefficients?? That way of calculating SNR?? I think you have to do Scroeder decay curve if you want to find it. I do not believe the amplitude of the noise, could be the thing I also saw with Max?? - Why do we even calculate SNR? Only measurement this is done for!? - could also be a result of the high output to the headphone?}

Taking the first 256 coefficients of the impulse response gives the following cropped impulse response, as seen on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop1}
	\input{figures/CancellationPath_MATLAB_Figures/CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop.tex}
	\caption{Cropped impulse response plot of the cancellation path. Impulse response 1 (\textcolor{MATLABblue}{---}), 
	impulse response 2 (\textcolor{MATLABorange}{---}), 	
	impulse response 3 (\textcolor{MATLAByellow}{---}), 	
	impulse response 4 (\textcolor{MATLABpurple}{---}), 	
	impulse response 5 (\textcolor{MATLABgreen}{---}).}
	\label{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCrop}
\end{figure}

To verify that the frequency response of the cropped impulse response approximately equals that of the non-cropped impulse response the two frequency responses are compared. This can be seen on \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}. Note that the two lines are almost on top of each other.
%\todoKiis{should we plot differences?}
%Oliver: in my opinion this is just fine.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\tikzsetnextfilename{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare1}

	\caption{Comparison of the frequency response of 256 coefficients (blue) vs. 288,768 coefficients (orange).}
	\label{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponseCompare}, 256 coefficients is shown to be sufficient for representing the frequency response with good accuracy. 

\subsection{Error Sources / Tolerances}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Placement of the headphones. (Position of the headphone on the ear  influences the frequency response at high frequencies). 
	%\todoOliver{Do we just mean the headphones? Because then write headphones}
	\item Instrument inaccuracies see \autoref{TolerancesCP}.
\end{itemize}

\end{table}

\subsection{Conclusion}
It can be concluded that an impulse response in the form of 256 coefficients, see \autoref{CancellationPathImpulseResponse}, is found for the "Cancellation path". %\todoKiis{again 256? Should we make a note in the top, that it's an old document?}
%The impulse response on  shows the coefficients of the system, and a file containing all 256 is generated with the name "CoeffientsCP.mat"
