\section{Test of Consumer Headphones}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this section is to determine the attenuation of the ANC on existing consumer headphones, for stochastic speech signals. 
Note that only the active part is tested, and not the passive damping made by the headphone cup.

\todoOliver{Change "ear" to "ear canal" It's kind of pointing at the microphone, avoidable? If the microphone symbol does not need explaining neither does the speaker symbol. The speaker symbol is not correct. The triangle should be on top of the bar. Directions on arrows! as for the microphone. It's RM[E] Fireface}

\subsection{Settings/Description}
\subsubsection{Control and calibration}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The speaker (6) is placed 1.6 meters from the HATS.
	\item The microphone in the Hats (2) is calibrated on the computer using Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered}.
	\begin{itemize} 
		\item Calibration is made @ 1 $k$Hz using the calibrator with adapter for the ear simulator. This should yield a signal of 95.6 dB. The measured intensity in MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} however was 78.12 so all measurements are multiplied by 7.48 to get a calibrated signal in Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Equipment settings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item This experiment is performed with a sampling rate of, $f_{s}$ = 48 $k$Hz. 
	\item In the mixing console on the computer 3 take care to turn on the "inst"-option. The following gain settings are present: 		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Line level gain is 0 dB
		\item Ear Microphones has gain +30 dB set on the front of the RME
		%\item Ref Microphones has gain +48 dB
		%\item Speaker Microphones has gain +48 dB
	\end{itemize}
	\item All settings on the computer is set to 0 dBFS
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Procedure}
	\subsubsection{Set-up}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Connect cable from the RMEs "Out 1L" to the speakers "Line in"
		\item Connect cable from the RME's "Out 1R" to the RME's "In 1L"
		\item Connect cable from the microphone in the ear simulator (2) to the microphone power supply's (7) "Input"
		\item Connect cable from the microphone power supply's "Output" to the RME's "IN 2R"
		\item Connect USB-cable from the computer to the RME
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsubsection{Performing Experiment}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Open Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and open and run file \path{OtherBrands.xls}
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item The simulations outputs a speech signal at 0 dBFS over the span of 12 seconds
			\begin{itemize}
				\item [] The signal constructed using speech-files from "The Archimedes Project" by Bang \& Olufsen. \\
				The signal is composed of three seconds of the UK male anechoic sample followed by three seconds of silence, followed by the UK female anechoic sample, and ends with another three seconds of silence.
			\end{itemize}
			\item The simulation runs for 14 seconds
		\end{itemize}
		\item Rename generated file \path{GeneratedANC} according to headphone tested, and whether or not ANC was enabled. E.g. \path{Denonon[1].wav} for the first test of the Denon AH GC20 headhpone with ANC enabled. Names in \path{evaluatePerformance.m}-script is named accordingly.

	\end{enumerate}
	Perform this experiment five times for each headphone where the headphone is removed and remounted on the HATS between measurements. 
		
\subsection{Data Extraction}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Open MATLAB\textsuperscript{\textregistered} and run script \path{evaluatePerformance.m}
\end{enumerate}

From performing the experiment, a list of files were generated, ten for each device tested; five with ANC enabled and five with ANC disabled. The list can be seen below, where [i] indicates the iteration of the experiment.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \path{Denonon[i].wav}			(Denon AH GC20 w/ ANC)
	\item \path{Denonoff[i].wav}		(Denon AH GC20 w/o ANC)
	\item \path{BoseQC15on[i].wav}		(Bose QuietComfort 15 w/ ANC)
	\item \path{BoseQC15off[i].wav}		(Bose QuietComfort 15 w/o ANC)
	\item \path{BoseQC25on[i].wav}		(Bose QuietComfort 25 w/ ANC)
	\item \path{BoseQC25off[i].wav}		(Bose QuietComfort 25 w/o ANC)
	\item \path{BOH8on[i].wav}			(B\&O BEOPLAY H8 w/ ANC)
	\item \path{BOH8off[i].wav}			(B\&O BEOPLAY H8 w/o ANC)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Analysis}
The difference between the enabled and the disabled ANC is plotted on figures \ref{fig:BOH8Comp}, \ref{fig:QC15Comp}, \ref{fig:QC25Comp} and \ref{fig:DenonComp} for each headphone tested.
 The frequency responses are made using the method described in \autoref{sec:OctaveBank}. Only the part containing male voice is analysed. The averaging is made by putting all five recordings through the filter bank after one another.

	\caption{Bose QuietComfort 25 measured in an anechoic chamber and averaged over five measurements, results were filtered using a 1/3 octave filter bank.}
	\label{fig:QC25Comp}
\end{figure}
According to the measurement Bose QuietComfort 25 gains significantly between 1 $k$Hz and 2 $k$Hz. This is not perceived when using the headphone, and might be an error in the measurement.

\end{figure}

In figure \autoref{fig:OtherBrandsTestCompare} a comparison can be seen, this representation provides a better overview of the attenuation of four headphones.

\subsection{Conclusion}
The relative difference between a headphones attenuation with and without ANC was found for four different consumer headphones.
