\section{Voice Recording}
This appendix describes the recording and subsequent manipulation of the sound used in the demonstration of the project results. The recording is in English. The speaker is a man with English as his second language. 

\subsection{Recording of speech}

\end{table}
The recording of speech is performed in an anechoic chamber, where a male speaker is situated 1 m from the microphone. The used microphone is supplied with Phantom Power from the sound card. \\ 
Computer->RME fireface -> mic with Phantom Power. Drawing\\\\

The parameters chosen for the recording, prediction and cancellation is
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N=1200$
	\item $O=1100$
	\item $M=1200$
	\item $P=10$
	\item Delay equal to $P=10$
	\item $f_s =48000$ Hz
	\item $\mu= lala$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The manuscript}
The manuscript is devided into sections, where different operations are made. Each section is stored in separate audio files for easier manipulation of the individual parts. 
 
\textbf{Normal voice}\\
This recording will demonstrate the performance of a Filtered X Least Mean Squares ANC algorithm combined with a Linear Prediction Algorithm. This was unfiltered sound. 

\textbf{HP filtered sound}\\
Imagine that you have now put headphones on. I am speaking to you from outside a headphone.

\textbf{FXLMS}\\
This resembles the experience you would get from a normal ANC headphone, when a person is speaking outside the headphone. 

\textbf{The predicted sound}\\
This is the predictor predicting 25 $m$s ahead in time. You are listening to an estimate of what I am going to say. Next you will listen to the filtered signal. 

\textbf{LP FXLMS}\\
You can not hear me now can you? If not it works!

\textbf{Summary}\\
Did it work for you? \\\\
The sections in the manuscript are filtered in the following way
\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tabular}{ c c } \toprule
		{Section}				& {Manipulation} \\ \bottomrule 
		Normal Voice			& No manipulation  	\\
		HP filtered sound		& Filtered with HP transfer function \\
		FXLMS					& Filtered with FXLMS	\\
		The predicted signal 	& The output of the predictor	\\
		LP FXLMS 				& The output of the proposed algorithm	\\
		Summary 				& No manipulation	\\
		\bottomrule
