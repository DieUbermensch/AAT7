\section{Voice Recording}
This appendix describes the recording and subsequent manipulation of the sound used in the demonstration of the project results. The recording is in English. The speaker is a man with English as his second language. 

\subsection{Recording of speech}

The recording of speech is performed in an anechoic chamber, where a male speaker is situated 1 m from the microphone. The used microphone is supplied with Phantom Power from the sound card. \\ 
Computer->RME fireface -> mic with Phantom Power. Drawing\\\\

The parameters chosen for the recording, prediction and cancellation is
\begin{itemize}
	\item $N=1200$
	\item $O=1100$
	\item $M=1200$
	\item $P=10$
	\item Delay equal to $P=10$
	\item $f_s =48000$ Hz
	\item $\mu= lala$
\end{itemize}


\subsection{The manuscript}
The manuscript is divided into sections, where different operations are made. Each section is stored in separate audio files for easier manipulation of the individual parts. 
 
\textbf{Normal voice}\\
This recording will demonstrate the performance of an Active Noise Control  system, in a headphone using Filtered X Least Mean Squares combined with a Linear Prediction Algorithm. 

\textbf{HP filtered sound}\\
Now imagine that you have put on your headphones. I am speaking to you from the outside of the headphones.

\textbf{FXLMS}\\
You have now activated the noise cancellation. This resembles the experience you would get from a noise cancelling headphone, when a person is speaking from outside of the headphone. 
Here no prediction was used. Now the predictor is activated. 

\textbf{LP FXLMS}\\
This is the Filtered-x Least Means Squares combined with the Linear Prediction algorithm. This should be almost inaudible to you. We will now listen to the predictor on it's own. 

\textbf{The predicted sound}\\
In case you didn't hear what I just said, you are now listening to the predictor predicting 25 $m$s ahead in time. You are listening to an estimate of what I am going to say.  

\textbf{Summary}\\
We hope you enjoyed the demonstration. Thank you for listening.\\\\

The sections in the manuscript are filtered in the following way
