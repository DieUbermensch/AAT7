\section*{Introduction}

\subsection*{Experiments}
All files used for simulation and evaluation for the following experiments, can be found on the attached CD, with this path: \path{D:/CD/Appendices/Appendix [X] - [Appendix_name]}. If the reader desires to compare their results to ours, they can take a step lower in the directories and locate the folder \path{Verification Results} within the appendix folder. \\
%The reader should always be critical towards all results. Even the ones conducted by this group.

\subsection*{Code}
The code used within this project is located in \path{D:/CD/DSP Code}. This is setup source- and header-files along with all functions used during this project.\\
The code was tested and verified to work on a Texas Instruments TMDX5515EZDSP. \\

\textbf{Note that does the reader wish to test this code on their own DSP, they should posses the necessary GEL and linker-files needed to operate the DSP.}
