\section*{Introduction}
\lettrine[lines=2]{A}{ctive} Noise Control (ANC) is becoming a widely used technique in consumer headphones to attenuate external noise. A parameter in ANC is the bandwidth which is determined by the system delay, introduced by sampling and processing the signal in the feedforward system. Consumer ANC headphones has a bandwidth that does not cover the entire frequency area of speech. This paper examines how to extend the bandwidth.

The general solutions in ANC are described thoroughly by Hansen et al. \cite{Hansen2}, \cite{Hansen}. The solution used as a reference in this paper is the digital feedforward system using the Filtered-X Least Mean Squares (FXLMS) method. To increase bandwidth a prediction algorithm is proposed as a potential solution. In order to do prediction, certain signal characteristics must be known, here speech is chosen as the noise source. Prediction of speech is described by Wai C. Chu \cite{Speech}. In this paper we will combine the reference solution with the prediction of speech to increase the bandwidth of a real time system.  

The paper is split into two parts. The first part describes the method used in the reference solution and how to predict speech using Linear Prediction (LP). The second part describes simulations and the implementation. Performance of the reference and the combined solution are determined and the increase in performance of the LP ANC system is verified.
