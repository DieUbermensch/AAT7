%% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
\lettrine[lines=2]{A}{ctive} Noise Control (ANC) is a used technique in a wide variety of applications. Research is being done in creating silents zones\cite{SilentZones}, Improving room acoustics using multiple loudspeakers\cite{CAPS} and is already available in various headphones, for noise cancellation, both for professional and consumer use. 

Noise canceling headphones are used in various environments which have different noise characteristics. These characteristics vary from periodic low frequency noise (60-400Hz), e.g. from machinery and helicopter rotor\cite{LowFrequency}, med-range frequency noise (100-4000Hz), e.g. speech\cite{MidFrequency}, to high frequency noise (8-12 Hz), e.g. turbine noise\cite{LowFrequency}. The high frequency noise is naturally attenuated by using a closed headphone cup\cite{naturalAttenuation} and static low frequency noise are attenuated by the present consumer headphones\cite{ConsumerANC}.

%%ANC are used by companies such as Bang \& Olufsen and Lyngdorf Audio in their proprietary technology as Active Room Compensation\texttrademark and RoomPerfect\texttrademark respectively, to control noise in a room using loudspeakers. Headphone industries have adapted it into cancellation of noise and is used

Assuming speech as the primary noise source, the solution used in this paper as a reference is a digital feedforward system using the Filtered-X Least Mean Squares (FXLMS). The solution is chosen due to it being the optimal system for non stationary signals. The general solutions in ANC are described thoroughly by Hansen et al. \cite{Hansen2}, \cite{Hansen}.

The problem of a feedforward system is the dependency of noise having a propagation delay from the noise source the source.

A parameter in ANC is the bandwidth which is determined by the system delay, introduced by sampling and processing the signal in the feedforward system. Consumer ANC headphones has a bandwidth that does not cover the entire frequency area of speech. This paper examines how to extend the bandwidth.

To increase bandwidth a prediction algorithm is proposed as a potential solution. In order to do prediction, certain signal characteristics must be known. Prediction of speech is described by Wai C. Chu \cite{Speech}. In this paper we will combine the reference solution with the prediction of speech to increase the bandwidth of a real time system.  

The paper is split into two parts. The first part describes the method used in the reference solution and how to predict speech using Linear Prediction (LP). The second part describes simulations and the implementation. Performance of the reference and the combined solution are determined and the increase in performance of the LP ANC system is verified.
