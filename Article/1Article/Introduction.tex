\lettrine[lines=2]{A}{ctive} Noise Control 
(ANC) is a method used in a wide variety of applications. Research in creating silent zones is being conducted \cite{SilentZones}, improving room acoustics using multiple loudspeakers \cite{CAPS} and is already available in various headphones.
\\\\
Noise canceling headphones are used in various environments with different noise characteristics. These characteristics vary from periodic low frequency noise (10 Hz -- 200 Hz), e.g. from machinery and helicopter rotors \cite{LowFrequency}, to mid-range frequency noise (200 Hz -- 4000 Hz), e.g. speech \cite{MidFrequency}, to high frequency noise (4 $k$Hz -- 20 $k$Hz), e.g. turbine noise \cite{LowFrequency}. The high frequency noise is passively attenuated by using a closed headphone cup \cite{naturalAttenuation}, and present consumer headphones are able to attenuate low frequency periodic noise \cite{naturalAttenuation}. The attenuation of speech using ANC in present market ANC headphones is shown in figure \ref{fig:ANCcompare}. \\\\

%%ANC are used by companies such as Bang \& Olufsen and Lyngdorf Audio in their proprietary technology as Active Room Compensation\texttrademark and RoomPerfect\texttrademark respectively, to control noise in a room using loudspeakers. Headphone industries have adapted it into cancellation of noise and is used 

This paper focuses on improving attenuation of speech. Hence speech will be seen as the only noise source. The solution proposed is based on a digital feedforward system using Filtered-$x$ Least Mean Squares (FXLMS). The solution is chosen due to it being the optimal system for non-stationary signals \cite{Hansen2}. The general solutions in ANC are described thoroughly by Hansen et al. \cite{Hansen}.

The problem of a feedforward system is the dependency of the system delay being smaller than the propagation time from the noise measured (1), to the error microphone (3), shown in \autoref{fig:SystemOverview}.

In a real-time system, delays are introduced by sampling and processing a signal. For instance, using a cost-wise $\Sigma\Delta$-converter a sampling/conversion delay is introduced. The specific delay values for a TLV320AIC3204 can be seen in \autoref{tab:DelayResults}.

%delay in the range of 220 $\mu$s to 880 $\mu$s is introduced, depending on a sampling frequency of 192 kHz to 48 kHz respectively.

Assuming a $\text{0}^{\circ}$ angle of incident, which is the ideal case, the reference microphone must be placed 75.5 $m$m -- 302 $m$m further out from the error microphone, to compensate for the delay. Instead a Linear Prediction (LP) scheme is proposed as a solution. In speech encoding Wiener filtering is often used \cite{Speech} therefore Wiener filtering is the choosen prediction method.
% This reduces computation time and overall
%Consumer ANC headphones has a bandwidth that does not cover the entire frequency area of speech. This paper examines how to extend the bandwidth.
%To increase bandwidth a prediction algorithm is proposed as a potential solution. 
Prediction of speech is described by Wai C. Chu \cite{Speech}. 
\\\\
This paper presents and compares the feedforward FXLMS system and the feedforward LP FXLMS system using Wiener filtering. Results of simulations and real time limitations are discussed.
