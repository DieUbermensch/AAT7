\section{Introduction}
\lettrine[lines=2]{A}{ctive} Noise Control (ANC) is a field of study, where a lot of algorithms are already known. \todo[inline]{$MENTION A FEW$} The scope of this paper is not to derive a new ANC algorithm, but rather to use an existing algorithm in a practical application. The application is cancellation of speech in a call centre The choice of a specific use case allows the frequency range and signal type of interest to be defined before designing the system. Call centres is an especially interesting environment for an ANC system, because the unwanted noise and the wanted signal have the same  characteristics as they are both speech. \\
The paper is split into three parts. The first part examines the demands for an ANC system to be used in a call centre. The second part discus the algorithm used and shows preliminary results from simulations. The third part describes the real time implementation of the algorithm and verifies the performance of the ANC system.
