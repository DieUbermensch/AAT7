Active Noise Control (ANC) is a widely used technique. However most solutions are targeted at attenuating static noise with limited bandwidth. This paper focusses on using prediction to improve attenuation for non stationary signals.
The solution proposed uses an FIR-filter adapted by an Filtered-$x$ Least Mean Square (FXLMS)-algorithm combined with Linear Prediction (LP) to attenuate a speech signal. This solution uses the quasi-periodic properties of speech to estimate the upcoming content of a speech signal. Thereby decreasing the sample delay in the system which increases bandwidth, yielding better attenuation.

%At this point in time a solution targeted at filtering out speech has not yet been derived - which is the motivation for this paper.


%GUESSWORK: Using the proposed Linear Prediction we were able to verify improved performance both through simulation and real time implementation.
%make a simulation and a real-time implementation with sufficient attenuation of a speech signal, and thus have successfully made an ANC solution that can filter out speech.
