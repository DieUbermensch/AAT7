\textbf{Abstract -} ANC is a widely used application, in many aspects. However most ANC solutions are based on filtering out static sounds, e.g. low-frequency noise from machinery. At this point in time a solution based on filtering out speech has not been researched and implemented yet - we sought out to discover a solution to this.
The solution uses a FIR-filter adapted by a FXLMS-algorithm, to cancel out a quasi-periodic speech signal. Furthermore this solution uses Linear Prediction to estimate the upcoming content of the speech signal. This is used decrease the sample delay in the system and thus increasing bandwidth and yielding better attenuation.




GUESSWORK: Using the proposed methods we were able to make a simulation and a real-time implementation with sufficient attenuation of a speech signal, and thus have successfully made an ANC solution that can filter out speech.
