ANC is a widely used technique. However most ANC solutions are based on filtering out static sounds, e.g. low-frequency noise from machinery. At this point in time a solution targeted at cancelling out speech has not been derived yet - which is the motivation for this paper.
The solution proposed uses a FIR-filter adapted by a FXLMS-algorithm, to cancel a speech signal. Furthermore this solution uses the quasi-periodic properties of speech to estimate the upcoming content of the speech signal using Linear Prediction. Thereby decreasing the sample delay in the system which increases bandwidth, yielding better attenuation.




%GUESSWORK: Using the proposed Linear Prediction we were able to verify improved performance both through simulation and real time implementation.
%make a simulation and a real-time implementation with sufficient attenuation of a speech signal, and thus have successfully made an ANC solution that can filter out speech.
