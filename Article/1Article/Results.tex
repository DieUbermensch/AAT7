\section{Results}
All results are obtained using Simulink\textsuperscript{\textregistered} which are systems build as described in Methods. The speech used throughout is Track 5 from the Archimedes project CD resampled to the used $f_s$.  
\\\\
The results are divied into firstly determining the parameters of the predictor and secondly testing the attenuation of feedforward FXLMS system compared to the feedforward LP FXLMS system.   

\subsection{Determining System Parameters}
The parameters which should be detemined are $f_s$, $P$, $N$ and $O$.         
The PG in relation to $f_s$ is shown in \autoref{tb:fsPredict}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$f_s$ {[}kHz{]} & 8 & 16 & 24 & 48 & 96 & 192 \\ \hline 
$N$ {[}$\cdot${]} & 100 & 200 & 300 & 600 & 1200 & 2400 \\ \hline 
PG {[}dB{]} & 13.522 & 15.950 & 14.722 & 20.831 & 35.031 & 43.803 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{PG as a function of $f_S$. Parameters for the simulation are $O=0$ and $P=1$.}
\label{tb:fsPredict}
\end{table}

To compare $f_s$ N must be scaled to represent the same time interval. $f_s$ is chosen to be 48 kHz. P is chosen to 43 samples which is the same as the converter delay shown in \autoref{tab:DelayResults}.  
The PG as a function of $N$ and $O$ is seen on \autoref{fig:Predict43}.

	\caption{PG as a function of different N and O with $P=43$.}
	\label{fig:Predict43}
\end{figure}

The PG of \autoref{fig:Predict43} is deemed a little low therefore a simulation is also made for $P=10$ shown in \autoref{fig:Predict10}.

	\input{figures/Articleillustrations/HammingNOP10.tex}
	\caption{PG as a function of different N and O with $P=10$.}
	\label{fig:Predict10}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{fig:Predict40} and \autoref{fig:Predict10} parameters $N$ and $O$ are chosen to be 1200 and 1100.
\subsection{Simulation of Feedforward LP FXLMS}

% At this point in time all results are not yet certain, however we will give an idea of how they are going to turn out.
% As presented in the paper thus far, we know what kind of noise we would like to cancel out and how we want to do it. The following list tells which graph will be used to show the results of the acceptance tests.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Prediction gain - The difference between the input signal and the estimated signal, measured in dB. Used in the LP part.
% \item A plot comparison of frequency response between: A pure signal, a signal with FXLMS noise attenuation and a signal with LP combined with FXLMS attenuation
% \item An expansion of \autoref{Fig:Reference to noise ratio}: As of now only attenuation is showed, but in the future another graph in the figure will show the attenuation of the FXLMS combined with LP - which should yield better attenuation at larger delays.

% \end{itemize}
