\begin{abstract}
Active Noise Control (ANC) is a widely used technique in consumer headphones for attenuating noise. ANC is good at attenuating periodic noise e.g. machinery but has limited ability to attenuate quasiperioc noise e.g. speech (50 Hz-4000 Hz). This paper therefore focusses on attenuation of speech. A widely used feedforward ANC system which uses an FIR-filter adapted by an Filtered-$x$ Least Mean Square (FXLMS)-algorithm is adopted. However using a $\Sigma\Delta$-converter which has a delay of 225 $\mu$s-900 $\mu$s decreases the attenuation of the used ANC system. A Linear Prediction (LP) method combined with multirate processing is proposed to compensate for the introduced conversion delay. Cascaded Wiener filtering is used to predict 10 samples ahead corresponding to 225 $\mu$s at 48 $k$Hz. A signal sampled at 192 $k$Hz decimated to 48 $k$Hz requires prediction of 10 samples.  
\\\\
The combined LP FXLMS system is found by simulation to have a 34 dB larger attenuation than the system without LP. The combined system yields a high attenuation for all frequencies in the speech area. No real time implementation is attempted because of high computation cost of the LP. This needs to be reduced for a real time implementation to be feasible.
